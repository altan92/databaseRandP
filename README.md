=============

Basic Idea: The basic idea of our project is to create a polling website that will store data in a MongoDB database. The driving idea is to be able to extract geological location and answers from a user and have them input additional information if they wish to see further information about the basic demographics of our answer. On the base, we will first ask a question and have the user pick an answer. Then we input that data into the database and then send back percentages of one answer compared to another. We then will display a map of the U.S and display the percentages for every state
